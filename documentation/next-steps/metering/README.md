# Understand Metering and Billing as an SAP Partner

### What Are the SAP BTP Packaging and Pricing Options?

There are currently four tranches:

**Standard Commitment**
* Fixed commitment for a term
* Mostly billed annually in advance
* Overage results in higher overall subscription based on negotiation
* Best for customers who know the scope, size & timing of usage

**Commitment + Overage**
* Min. upfront commit + overage (PAYG) at premium
* Advance billing for commitment, rest in arrears for overage
* Best if you know scope, size & timing of usage for a fixed portion, want flexibility for rest

**Flexible Commitment + Overage (CPEA)**
* Fixed commitment, overage at premium. Multiple services can be used without service-specific commit
* Advance billing for commit, overage in arrears, commit to consume â†’ billing in arrears for actual use
* Best if you need consumption with service level flexibility

**"Zero Commit" PAYG**
* No upfront commitment, no discount, premium prices vs subscription
* Billed in arrears for actual usage (like utility bill)
* Best if you want complete flexibility in scope, size & timing of usage
