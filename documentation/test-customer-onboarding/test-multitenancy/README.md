# OPTIONAL: Test the Multitenancy

As this tutorial explains how to create a multitenant application, you probably want to test the multitenancy. In the previous sections, we have onboarded the customer City Scooter. We have prepared some data in the Business Partner mock server to onboard a second customer called Bike Sharing. This is of course optional and not needed for the rest of the tutorial.

To onboard a second customer, you need of course to go through the following steps again:
* [Create a Customer Subaccount](../../../documentation/test-customer-onboarding/create-consumer-subaccount/README.md)
* [Configure a Destination](../../../documentation/test-customer-onboarding/configure-destination/README.md)
* [Subscribe to the Easy Franchise Application](../../../documentation/test-customer-onboarding/subscribe-easyfranchise-app/README.md)
* [Manage Users](../../../documentation/test-customer-onboarding/manage-users/README.md)
* [Run the Application](../../../documentation/test-customer-onboarding/run-application/README.md)
