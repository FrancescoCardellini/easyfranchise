# Welcome to the Mission

In this mission, you will learn how to develop a multitenant application running on the Kyma environment of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
The application called Easy Franchise is an extension of SAP S/4HANA Cloud and has been build based using microservices. Due to the complexity of this topic, our team has taken some compromise compared to a real application. So, this application doesn't aim to be used for productive usage. See the following solution diagram of the EasyFranchise application:

You can find the code of the application components in this GitHub [repository](/code).

## Who Is This Mission For?

The business scenario of this tutorial has been created with the partner as focus persona. The purpose of this project is to help SAP partners to get a quick start on developing a multitenant application and provide best practices. This is of course not exclusively for SAP partner and can be useful for every person looking for details on how to build a multitenant application running on Kyma. It is suitable for new or experienced developers on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
